I choose to focus on the COVID datasets because it is now topical and seemed the most interesting. The main reason I choose MongoDB for the mysimbdp-coredms component is the flexibility in schema it provides. This is important for the COVID datasets because there are various types of datasets which stores different types of data. For instance there are datasets which shows the daily and weekly new cases and deaths and there are datasets which show hospital admission rates, both of which have different schemas.  Other reasons for using MongoDB is that it seem quite popular and therefore there exists support when I run into trouble, and lastly there is python package for MongoDB which is my programming language of choice.

I decided docker containers as test deployment enviroment as it abled me to test and prove my design locally without using monetary resources on cloud services.
